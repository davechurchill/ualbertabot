Compilation Instructions:

1. Install the required libraries for the SparCraft GUI

libsdl2-dev
libsdl2-image-dev

   If you wish to compile without the GUI enabled, #define SPARCRAFT_NOGUI in source/SparCraftExperiment.cpp
   When you reach step 6, run 'make SparCraft_NOGUI' instead of just make
   
2. Clone the BWAPI github repository somewhere on your system

git clone https://github.com/bwapi/bwapi.git

3. Edit the Makefile to point to the directory that you cloned BWAPI

BWAPI_DIR=/where_you_cloned_to/bwapi/bwapi  (yes, bwapi/bwapi)

4. If your BWAPI_DIR doesn't contain the file svnrev.h, you need to generate it using the vbs script in that dir
   (note: this may have to be done in windows, but you can just copy the generated .h files to Linux and it will work)

5. Depending on your compiler, you may have to make the fix to a BWAPI header outlined here:
   https://github.com/bwapi/bwapi/issues/678#issuecomment-241218319
   
6. Run 'make' in the SparCraft directory, the binary will go to the 'SparCraft/bin' directory

7. cd to 'SparCraft/bin' and run ./SparCraft - it will read SparCraft_Config.txt from SparCraft/bin as the config file

Enjoy!
